Originally I wanted to host the app through Heroku so I could utilize the free tier but Heroku only opens port 80 and the media server requires other ports for peers to be able to connect to. I ended up using DigitalOcean for hosting and am currently paying for it with coupons I find on the internet.</p>","excerpt":"I recently discovered a webRTC tool called MediaSoup and I thought it would be fun to experimentâ€¦","frontmatter":{"date":"April 25, 2021","slug":"/blog/pepehouse","title":"PepeHouse"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"936c4b44-7941-5679-b647-df01cb6795ab","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/pepehouse","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["143701507"]}
