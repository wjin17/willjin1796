This section covers envisioning.</p>\n<p>The best founders act like physicists, developing hypotheses and testing them in practical ways. Having a founder that changes their mind on what their product is 10 times before launching a single thing means that you will be building, destroying, and rebuilding things without a definitive pupose. On top of that, you might end up adding a bunch of random features that no one even cares about which, technically, isn't horrible if one of those things turns out to be a huge winner. Regardless, the founder has to have the core vision planned out which will be the foundation for the product.</p>\n<!-- Here's a story to give you an idea of what I mean. One of the companies I worked at wanted to charge its users a subscription model for a daily service. How long were the billing periods going to be and what would happen if the customer didn't want the service on a particular day? No clue. For something like this, I suggested one time purchase model but it just had to be subscriptions for x reason. Alright, let's try to figure it out then.\n\nThe computer science solution is to have a situation where you prepay for all of the following week's coffee. That way customers can customize their weekly order and we can have subscriptions. What if the customer decides to cancel a day's order? In that case, track the number of undelivered product and subtract it from the next bulk order. Alright let's implement it and demo it. The problem was that it was hard to understand, the explanation above took 3 sentences to say. Putting 3 sentences in an explanation into just the billing process is asking for a lot. Alright, that's a valid point, lets explore something more familiar. This billing process is actually just a top off method with extra steps. Let's remove the extra steps and let users refill their account at will. I hear \"but that's not a subscription\" after I suggest it but I really believe in just using a top off method. First, a lot of popular companies use it and people are used to that model. Second, it's very transparent to the user what is going on. How much they put in, use, and what they got. Lastly, we could give free credits to users as a payment tier bonus. At this point I'm super antsy to launch. I've built the app, created a backend that's able to automatically process payments and orders, send them to the backend, and receive menu updates from that backend. Now the paradigm was wrong. I designed it so that users could save their customized drink and toggle it on or off for that day's order. Instead, it had to be a weekly calendar that people manually orgnize drinks in. Then I was shown an app made with a no-code platform that does a poor job of the calendar and has, you guessed it, one time payments where the user can only order at most 1 drink a day.\n\n\n -->","excerpt":"My leadership professor talked about leadership as a sum of 4 components.
