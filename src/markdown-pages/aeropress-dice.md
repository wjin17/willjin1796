One of my loves in life is delicious coffee. It tastes great and making it is kind of like some form of morning meditation. Setting up the kettle, grinding the beans, and preparing a hot cup of coffee is essential to a great morning for me.

An Aeropress is one of the best and easiest ways to make coffee. Just take your grinds, pour them in along with some hot water, and press. On the other hand, it can be as complicated as you want to make it. A famous coffee fanatic named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Hoffman</a> created a set of <a href="https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dice</a> that gives you different recipes based off what you roll. Fortunately, if you don't want to buy them, a developer named <a href="https://github.com/thewinniewu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winnie Wu</a> created a <a href="https://thewinniewu.github.io/aeropress-dice/" target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that lets you do the same thing.

I really liked this idea but I thought it could be improved so I created a <a href="https://github.com/wjin17/aeropress-dice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fork</a> and added some features.

### Additions

1. Updated to the latest version of React
2. Refactored code to utilize functional components and hooks
3. Converted files to Typescript
4. Seed for replicating recipes to share
5. Timer buttons inspired by maximmoinat's <a href="https://maximmoinat.github.io/aeropress-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a>
6. Share buttons for social media
7. Improved mobile view
