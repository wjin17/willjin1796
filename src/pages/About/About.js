        <h4>
          I am a software and electrical engineer currently living in the Bay
          Area. I received a BS in Electrical Engineering in May of 2019, mainly
          working with verilog and analog circuits. I started exploring software
          development in my senior year and primarily focus on web development.

          Outside of engineering, I enjoy skateboarding, weight lifting,
          gardening, 3D printing, reading, listening to podcasts, and making
          kombucha.
